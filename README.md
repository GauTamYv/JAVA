Hello everyone,
My name is Gautam Kumar. I am currently a B.Tech second-year student at GLA University, Mathura, India, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity.

I am originally from Buxar, Bihar, and I completed my schooling from RPS College, Patna.

I have a strong ability to learn quickly and consider myself a good problem solver. Currently, I am studying Artificial Intelligence and actively exploring the field of Cybersecurity.

In the future, I aspire to become a successful person with good values and character. I am always open to collaborating on meaningful ideas—if you have an idea that can help solve a problem for humanity, feel free to connect with me, and we can work on it together.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to Hindi songs, and I love playing chess and cricket.
